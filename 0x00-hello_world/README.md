Late but let's start learning C!

Task 0 - running a file through the pre processor (gcc -E), file name was $CFILE, output to particular file using ">".

Task 1 - compile but do not link (gcc -c), file name was the variable i set ($CFILE) didn't need to specify .o newname.

Task 2 - says to generate assemble code, but gcc -S gives final product of compiler. I use it anyway.
